##Overview
This is a solution accelerator to flexibly deploy an end-to-end analytics platform based on the services in the [Analytics end-to-end with Azure Synapse](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/example-scenario/dataplate2e/data-platform-end-to-end) Azure Architecture. It's implemented through the use of [Azure Bicep](https://github.com/Azure/bicep) declarative infrastructure as code. The aim is to accelerate the successful deployment, validation, and usage of Azure Data Services that make up a valuable end-to-end analytics platform tailored for business use needs.
